## Command rails db:create db:migrate failed max length

Console Error:

ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql2::Error: Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes (ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid)

Fix guide:

1. Community mentioned that change column string length to 100, but this method did not work for me.
2. But this works for me, I switch db engine from MyISAM to InnoDB, no more action needed.
3. DONE
